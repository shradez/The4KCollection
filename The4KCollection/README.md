Console-based, interactive inventory system of 4K Blu Rays my brother and I own. Work in progress.

6/16/21: Main menu option 1 and its sub options all work great and are formatted nicely. Next steps are implementing functionality for main menu option 2, which will take some tedious work considering
I'll have to go through the blurays.txt file and add 2 or 3 genres to each movie then update the createCollection() method to include those segments for each object, the latter task being 
hopefully rather quick and painless. And that's all before I can even start filling out the Application class to add all the selection options and get them working, including implementing 
comparator methods for genre list ordering.
